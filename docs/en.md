# Dreame

Control the robot vacuums of your Dreamehome account from Gladys Assistant.

This integration serves the robots **paired in the Dreamehome app**. It goes
through the Dreamehome cloud, as these robots offer no command on the local
network, and receives their changes **in real time**: a clean that ends, an error
or a return to the dock shows up in Gladys at once.

> A Dreame robot paired in the **Xiaomi Home** app (Mi Home) answers on another
> cloud: it is not supported by this integration.

## Features

For each robot of your account:

- **State** — cleaning, paused, returning to the dock, charging, docked, error.
- **Cleaning** — start a full clean (or resume the paused one), and stop it. The
  robot cleans the whole home with the current **Cleaning mode** and settings.
- **Return to dock**, **Pause / resume** (a second press restarts the robot) and
  **Locate the robot** (it plays a sound).
- **Cleaning mode** — _Vacuum_, _Mop_, _Vacuum and mop_, _Mop after vacuum_ or
  _Customize room cleaning_ (each room keeps the settings chosen for it in the
  app), as in the app. Offered on the robots whose mops lift.
- **Suction power** — _Quiet_, _Standard_, _Strong_ or _Max_, and **Max suction
  power** (for the next clean only, as in the app).
- **Mop wetness** — from 1 (slightly dry) to 32 (wet).
- **Mop washing frequency** — _By area_, _By time_ or _By room_, with two sliders:
  the area (m²) between two washes _by area_, and the time (minutes) _by time_.
  Each slider acts when its frequency is chosen; otherwise its value is kept for
  when it is. The wetter the mops, the more often they are washed: above 26, no
  more than 20 m² or 20 minutes between two washes.
- **Cleaning route** — _Quick_, _Standard_, _Intensive_ or _Deep_, on the robots
  that have this setting. A mode that vacuums only has _Quick_ and _Standard_:
  switching to one brings an _Intensive_ or _Deep_ route back to _Standard_, as
  the app does.
- **Battery**, and **Error**: the message of the robot in plain words ("Main brush
  tangled", "Clean water tank empty"...), "No error" otherwise.
- **Last clean - area** and **Last clean - duration** — in m² and minutes, those of
  the clean under way while it runs, with their history.
- **Room to clean** — the rooms of your robot's map; picking one starts cleaning
  it, and the list goes back to "—" once the room is done.
- **Several rooms** — a **Selection** switch per room, and the **Clean the
  selection** button that cleans the rooms switched on, **in the order you
  switched them on**, as in the app. To change the order, switch the rooms off,
  then on again in the order you want (switching on a room already on does not
  move it). The selection and its order are kept from one clean to the next,
  Gladys or the integration restarting included.

  > The robots that offer _Customize room cleaning_ (and the fifth generation)
  > get the rooms in that order, but not their order numbers: sending them stops
  > those robots. Their firmware may then follow the **cleaning order** set in the
  > Dreamehome app instead of yours. Watch which order your robot takes: if it is
  > the app's, set the order you want there.

- **Shortcuts** — one button per shortcut created in the Dreamehome app. It keeps
  all its settings: rooms, order, suction, water flow, passes, mopping.
- **Consumables** — the remaining life, in percent, of each wear part your robot
  tracks: brushes, filter, sensors, mop pads and, depending on the station, tank
  filter, detergent, squeegee... Only the parts your model has are offered, as in
  the app.

Only the features your robot actually has are offered.

The settings apply to the next clean, started from Gladys or from the app, unless
**CleanGenius** is on in the app: the robot then chooses by itself.

> On the dashboard, Gladys shows the generic name of a feature that is alone of its
> type: **Run Mode** is the cleaning (_Clean_ / _Idle_; _Mapping_ is not supported)
> and **Text** the error message. These rows can be renamed in the dashboard box.

## Dashboard widgets

With Gladys 5.1 or later, the integration offers four widgets (**Edit the
dashboard** → **Add a widget**). Each shows the robot picked in its settings, or
the first robot of the account.

> Gladys widgets are read and tapped: they have, by design, no dropdown nor
> slider. For **every setting** with its lists and sliders, add a **Devices** box
> with the setting features of the robot (mode, suction, max suction, route,
> wetness, washing frequency and intervals) next to the **Robot vacuum** widget.

- **Robot vacuum** — the name and state of the robot, the **map of the home**
  (rooms in colors, **path of the robot** — white where it vacuumed, blue where it
  only mopped —, dock in green, robot in white on top, ringed in green when on its
  dock), a list and four buttons: _Clean_, _Pause_, _Dock_, _Locate_. The list
  gives the battery, the **last clean** (area and duration), then the wear of each
  part, the most worn first; when room runs out, the least worn part is the one
  left out. The **List** setting of the widget turns it into the battery, the
  current settings (mode, suction, route, wetness), the last clean and the most
  worn part. _Clean_ cleans the whole home, or only the rooms whose **Selection**
  switch is on, in the order they were switched on: the button then reads _Clean
  the selection_. A paused robot offers _Resume_. The path is the one of the clean
  under way, or of the last one, as the robot sends it with its map; a robot that
  sends none keeps the map alone. The map is
  read again every minute while cleaning, every 30 minutes otherwise, and only
  while a dashboard shows it. Room names are not written on it.
- **Robot setting** — a single setting as big buttons, the current choice ticked,
  at hand on a tablet: **Cleaning mode**, **Suction power**, **Max suction
  power**, **Cleaning route**, **Mop wetness** (_Slightly dry_, _Damp_, _Wet_) or
  **Mop washing frequency**, picked in the widget settings. The _Customize room
  cleaning_ mode, the exact wetness and the washing interval are set in the
  **Devices** box.
- **Quick clean** — up to four buttons. Without settings, the shortcuts of the
  Dreamehome app; otherwise, write in **Button 1** to **4** the name of a
  shortcut or a room as Gladys shows it (case and accents do not matter), several
  rooms joined by "+" ("Kitchen + Living room"), or "Clean the selection". A
  name that matches nothing is reported in the widget, with the names it knows.
  The button of the task under way is ticked. Handy on a wall tablet. Gladys shows
  four buttons at most per widget: for more, add a second **Quick clean** and name
  its buttons.
- **Robot maintenance** — the three most worn parts as gauges, then every part
  tracked, the most worn first: red under 10 %, orange under 30 %.

## Configuration

1. In the integration, **Actions** box, fill in **Link the account**: the email
   (or phone number) and password of your Dreamehome account, then its region —
   the one chosen in the app when the account was created — and click the button.
2. Open the **Discovery** tab and add your robots to Gladys.

The password is only used to log in. It is never stored: only a fingerprint, the
one the Dreamehome app sends itself, is kept to reopen the session without asking
you anything. The **Unlink the account** action erases everything.

> An account created with Google, Apple or a text message code has no password.
> Set one first in the Dreamehome app (profile, account settings), then link the
> account here.

The **Language of the names** setting picks the language of the feature names, room
names and error messages. Feature names are set when the device is created.

When an update of the integration adds features, or when you create a shortcut or
a room in the app, the **Discovery** tab offers to **update** the device (rooms
and shortcuts are read again every 6 hours, or at once with **Scan**).

## In scenes

- Trigger on the **state**: for instance, be warned when the robot goes "Error",
  then read the message of the **Error** feature.
- "Control a device" action: **Cleaning** on _Clean_ to start the robot, **Room to
  clean** on a room, or a **Shortcut** button.
- Several rooms: switch their **Selection** on in the order to clean them, then
  press **Clean the selection**. To force an order, switch every room off first,
  then on one by one. The mode and settings are set the same way, before
  starting.

## Reporting a problem

The **Diagnostic** action shows what the integration sees of your robots: model,
firmware, raw values, map reading. Paste its result into a Gladys forum post or a
GitHub issue. It contains no email, no identifier and no room name.

## Limitations

- The cleaning mode and the mop settings are only offered to the models whose
  encoding the integration knows (from the model table of the Home Assistant
  integration): a wrong write would change your settings. An app shortcut covers
  the other cases.
- Mapping is started from the Dreamehome app, not from Gladys.
- The robots of the MOVAhome and Trouver apps are not supported.
- This integration was written without a robot at hand, from the protocol of the
  reference Home Assistant integration: your feedback (and the result of the
  **Diagnostic**) validates it model by model.
